I've created a fork of the original ACP commander project with the goal of making it work more reliably with newer devices.

So far I have:
*corrected some issues preventing the project from building from the provided source.
*created a build script to simplify building from source.
*fixed an authentication bug which prevented most commands from working without also send the "-pw" command, this prevented many built in functions such as "-o" from working on many devices as well.
*added logic to "-o" to allow root access via telnet to work on virtually every device model (all but the LS500 out of those so far tested).
*improved the shell option "-s" to work more robustly allowing limited shell-like access on devices without telnet (such as the LS500).
*added support for the newer discovery protocol allowing more of the newer devices to be supported.
*reworked the authentication logic to attempt the default password if none is provided, also prompt for password whenever initial authentication fails. 
*replaced jittery password prompt with standard version included with java 1.6+ 
*removed a bunch of "dead" code that is not actually referenced in the project.

A few of the changes have resulted in the minimum java version now being 1.7 which is what the provided jar is built with.

Let me know if you run into any issues.

Full usage details can be seen by running:
java -jar acp_commander.jar
