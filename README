I've created a fork of the original ACP commander project with the goal of making it work more reliably with newer devices.

So far I have:
*fixed an authentication bug which prevented most commands from working with out also send the "-pw" command, this prevented many built in functions such as "-o" from working on many devices as well.
*added logic to "-o" to allow root access via telnet to work on virtually every device model (all but the LS500 out of those so far tested).
*improved the shell option "-s" to work more robustly allowing limited shell-like access on devices without telnet (such as the LS500).
*added support for the newer discovery protocal allowing more of the newer devices to be supported.


Full usage details can be seen by running:
java -jar acp_commander.jar
